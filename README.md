#Abstractive Text Summarization using LSTM
Welcome to the Abstractive Text Summarization project repository. This project implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)-based approach for summarizing large text documents. The model focuses on generating concise and coherent summaries by learning the sequential structure of the text data.

Project Overview
Abstractive Text Summarization aims to generate summaries that may include new words and phrases, unlike extractive summarization which selects parts from the original text. The LSTM model is well-suited for sequential data like text, making it effective for learning long-term dependencies in document summarization.

In this project, LSTM models are used to understand the context and relationships in the input text to generate an abstract summary.

Features
Preprocessing: Tokenizes and prepares the text for model input, including padding sequences for LSTM compatibility.
Model Training: Implements an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism.
Summarization Pipeline: Provides an interface for summarizing input text after model training.
Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using standard summarization metrics such as ROUGE.
Installation

Model Architecture
This project utilizes an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model for summarization. It consists of:

Encoder: Encodes the input sequence (document) using LSTM layers.
Decoder: Generates the summary sequence using another set of LSTM layers.
Attention Mechanism: Improves the model by focusing on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding, which enhances the quality of the summaries.

Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the performance of your trained LSTM model using the ROUGE score by running:

Dataset
You can use any suitable dataset for abstractive summarization. Some commonly used datasets include:

CNN/Daily Mail Dataset
XSum Dataset
Ensure that your dataset is tokenized and preprocessed correctly before training the LSTM model.

Results
The LSTM model's performance is evaluated using ROUGE scores, a standard metric for summarization. The results will help assess how well the model is generating meaningful and accurate summaries.
