# Abstractive Text Summarization using LSTM

Welcome to the **Abstractive Text Summarization** project repository. This project implements an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**-based approach for summarizing large text documents. The model focuses on generating concise and coherent summaries by learning the sequential structure of the text data.

## Project Overview

Abstractive Text Summarization aims to generate summaries that may include new words and phrases, unlike extractive summarization which selects parts from the original text. The LSTM model is well-suited for sequential data like text, making it effective for learning long-term dependencies in document summarization.

In this project, LSTM models are used to understand the context and relationships in the input text to generate an abstract summary.

## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Tokenizes and prepares the text for model input, including padding sequences for LSTM compatibility.
- **Model Training:** Implements an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism.
- **Summarization Pipeline:** Provides an interface for summarizing input text after model training.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using standard summarization metrics such as ROUGE.
